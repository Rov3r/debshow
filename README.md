This github repo is PURELY for the purpose of having a safe place to download deb files that are PUBLIC and are STABLE and are FREE.

I personally see nothing wrong in trying to have a medium where safety is the number one priority, and piracy is not allowed.

Like I said earlier, all tweaks are stable. I will not upload anything that has not been first tested.

If you'd like something added, or would like to voice your concerns, please let me know on twitter.

I'm not trying to be an idiot about this. This is primarily a project for me to make a landing page and learn to manage live files.

Again, please voice concerns/requests to Rov3rRepo on twitter.

(Per request of the developer, I will remove their respective tweaks.)
